Analysing Kidney Disease: Using Statistical Methods and Predictive Techniques in R This project explores Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) risk factors by integrating statistical analysis and machine learning methods to aid early detection and personalized intervention strategies.

We use R programming to apply:

Descriptive statistics and probability distributions to summarize and understand patient data.

Correlation and regression analysis to assess relationships between clinical attributes and kidney function (measured by GFR).

ANOVA to examine group differences in clinical markers.

K-means clustering to identify patient risk groups.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification of CKD presence.

Apriori algorithm for discovering lifestyle and medical risk pattern associations.

Dataset: Chronic Kidney Disease dataset sourced from Kaggle (1,659 patients with demographic, lifestyle, and clinical features).

Key Findings:

Weak individual predictors for GFR were identified (age, BMI, blood pressure).

K-means clustering effectively categorized patients into low, moderate, and high-risk groups.

Apriori association rules revealed significant co-occurrences like smoking habits, hypertension, and diabetes in CKD patients.

Data-driven insights show the importance of combining clinical, demographic, and lifestyle factors for better CKD screening.

Tools & Libraries Used:

R: dplyr, ggplot2, cluster, arules, caret

Statistical methods: Regression, Correlation, ANOVA

Machine Learning: KNN, K-means Clustering, Association Rule Mining

Objective: Improve early detection, risk profiling, and personalized care for CKD patients through robust data analysis and predictive modeling.
